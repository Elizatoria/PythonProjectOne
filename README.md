This is a copy of Project One from the Development Repository, but I have been working on finding shorter ways to do some of the tests. 
I already figured out how to combine the Letter Number Test and the Underscore Test, so I just made 3 lines of code into one.
So far, those are the only tests that can be improved. The others are as short as they can get.
